# Inclusion Rider
A sample [speaker's rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_rider) to share with event organizers. The goal is to clarify AV, safety, and licensing details while promoting inclusive event organizing.

The manner in which you share this rider with event organizers is important. You may choose not to share it at all, and use it as a sort of checklist for yourself. You may have the bandwidth and wherewithal to help them work through it, or not. They may be able to address all the considerations, or not. They may be totally agreeable when you share it, they might even be totally agreeable if exasperated because this stuff requires work, ... or they might respond poorly. This will be easier for seasoned and sought after speakers to pull off.

The author's intent is to use whatever leverage they may have as a speaker to encourage event organizers to think holistically about logistics. The aim is to help events be multipliers of positive change rather than propogators of an unjust status quo.
